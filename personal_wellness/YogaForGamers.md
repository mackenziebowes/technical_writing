# Yoga for Gamers: Posture Correction Poses

The human body is excellent at adapting to it's environment. If you spend a lot of time on the computer, driving, or on the couch, you'll earn yourself some adaptions that make your body feel unbalanced.
You'll discover yourself in a rut, and find it difficult to move around.

There are many solutions to this issue - this document is just one.

It's optimized for folks with ADHD - people who lose track of time, hyperfocus, and struggle with consistency.

The plan, here, is to get gamers moving throughout the day - after each Battle Royale or Ranked Match, spend just 5 minutes engaging in these poses to counteract the 10-50 you just spent engaging the opposite muscle groups.

## A note on the Holds

If you can't do 30 seconds when you start, that's completely fine.

First, just *do* the poses at all - even just 1 second is great. It builds the habit.

Next, consider employing something called a pranayama in Hindi or a xingqi in Chinese - a focused breathing technique.

One excellent technique is something called Triphasic breathing - breaking the act of cycling air into 6 steps.

## Triphasic Breathing

Use each muscle group one at a time, then do the opposite action in reverse order.

### Diaphragm

The diaphragm is a muscle behind the abdominals - to breathe with it, push the diaphragm out in front of you. Make your belly as big as you can. This creates room below the lungs for them to expand into, increasing the amount of air they can hold.

### Intercostal

The intercostal muscles are around the ribs. To breathe with them, imagine spreading your chest wide, side-to-side, towards your arms. This pulls the lungs wide, allowing them to hold more air.

### Trapezius

Finally, the shoulders - when we're panicking or winded, we typically breathe with these naturally. Literally pull your shoulders up towards your ears to drag the top of the lungs up, allowing them to get more air.

### Exhalation

Do everything in reverse order - shoulders down and relaxed **AND THEN** chest relaxed and contained **AND THEN** belly tight and activated.

### Why?

Focusing on these small steps while holding a pose controls your attention - you won't be as motivated to avoid the discomfort of the poses and can endure them longer by placing your mind elsewhere.
